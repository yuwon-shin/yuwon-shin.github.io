I am currently a M.S. student in <a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/" style ="color:#867DDA;">CS Department</a> at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and 
supervised by <a href="http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?UichinLee" style ="color:#867DDA;">Prof. Uchin Lee</a> in ICLab@KAIST. 
I received my B.S. degree in <a href="http://mbe.ewha.ac.kr/" style ="color:#867DDA;">Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering</a> from Ewha Womans University in 2021.

Recently, I want to do a study of predicting certain situations or suggesting proactive solutions by utilizing data. 
To more specific, I am interested in building a smart environment that can improve user quality of life or increase productivity through sensor data analysis.
